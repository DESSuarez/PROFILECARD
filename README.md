## My process

I began this challenge by reading the 'readm.me' archive after downloading my zip file. Once I understood the task and reviewed the provided resources and tools, including the style guide, I created a new repository in Github, built in a new index.html file, a CSS style sheet, and normalize sheet to initiate the design process. Throughout the challenge, I kept both the desktop and mobile design JPGs open on my monitor, allowing me to compare the original design with my own development (this process made it a little bit more frustrating this time). 

Subsequently, I delved into writing my HTML code while ensuring careful attention was given to structuring the required content effectively. This aspect wasn't particularly difficult since the challenge was concise. Afterwards, I proceeded to open my CSS file and define the global properties in the style sheet. I linked both my CSS style sheet and Normalize sheet to my HTML file, following the same process for the Google Fonts API. Next, I began defining the colors to be applied and proceeded to style the text and title (H1) according to the specifications outlined in the style guide.

Continuously, I made adjustments to the container that held the Profile Card, text height, and centered vertically my elements without adding any extra margin to the header and footer sections, so it started to to closely resemble the original design. To ensure responsiveness, I incorporated media queries and utilized various CSS custom properties to give the margins a rounded appearance. Finally, I visually compared both designs and tested my development using the Responsively App.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media Querys and responsive design
- NO FRAMEWORKS

### What I learned

I learned a lot throughout this challenge, specificly working out the background issues. I love using CSS grid to organize my content, and that helped me work out some problems. Throughout the process, I gained insights into the time required to sketch a design from scratch independently. Also, i learned to manage better my local repositories and to commit changes to Git Hub. I take pride in what I have achieved here and eagerly look forward to completing future challenges.

### Continued development

Since Frontend is what I would like to do in my future jobs, I will continue developing this projects in Frontend Mentor at first without any frameworks, to achieve some solid basics in coding. Moving forward, my focus will be on efficient decision-making, allowing me to continue development without fixating on achieving pixel-perfection. Additionally, I aim to write cleaner code that is understandable to everyone while maintaining a lean size for optimal performance on web servers.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://web-toolbox.dev/en/tools/image-compare-slider) - This web helped me get a better design and compare my solutions with the original designs. 
- [Resource 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbQ2bYHxxEA&list=LL&index=6) - This video helped me get a better understanding of how to manage a local repository and push it to Git Hub.
- [Resource 3](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow) - This helped me with the box shadow effect in the design. I really reccomend this source, it's easy to use and has great coverage.
- [Resource 4](https://responsively.app/download/) - This is an amazing app that helps with building a responsive design. You can emulate your frontend design as in an Iphone, IPad, Mac and in many other screen devices.
